# Week 3

This week I implemented a naive minimax algorithm that works on a 3x3 grid. Now you can play against computer in the main program. I also added some javadoc documentation and test for ai. Next week I have to start working on evaluation function to make the game playable on a bigger grid and also add alpha-beta pruning for performance. Also need to write more tests for ai.
