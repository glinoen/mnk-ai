# Week 5

This week I made an evaluation function for the program(this evaluation function is suitable for the gomoku game that is a 15x15x5 game). It doesn't currently work with the algorithm. There is a lot of optimizing to do. Such as only searching near the played symbols and saving already calculated values to a hash map. Next week I've to work with these issues. I wasn't able to do the peer review because labtool is down.
