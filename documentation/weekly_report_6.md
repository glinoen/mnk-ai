# Week 6

Finally got the heuristic working with the algorithm(the reason was a missing minus-sign). Now I can finally start to optimize the program and make my own data structures. Didnt feel useful to start working on those before the program was behaving correctly.
Next week I'm going to work on optimizing(such as saving already calculated values to a hash map.), testing and documentation.
